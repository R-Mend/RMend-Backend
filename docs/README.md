## Node Report Manager

> A report manager API.

## What it is

Node Report Manager allows you to create and manage reports for any of your need. The idea is to give you a base for create sytems that allow the creation of users and have them create reports to then send to a main repository you can then review and manage.

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for setup instructions.
